# OS-1796 — BLE photo to phone: deliver/save locally instead of webhook round-trip

Ticket: https://linear.app/mentralabs/issue/OS-1796
Status: plan (2026-07-28); stack consolidated 2026-09-11 — firmware gate #3616
(keys on `transferMethod`), Bluetooth SDK PRs 1+2b folded into #3619 (rebased on
dev, `exposure` union deferred), PR 3 (#3622) rewritten to hand the miniapp an
inline `dataUrl` instead of a runtime-served URL (see the Miniapp SDK section).

## Problem

Every SDK photo today has exactly one delivery mechanism: an HTTP multipart POST to
`webhookUrl`. The BLE path is a pure relay — the phone reassembles the image from the
glasses and then re-uploads it to the *same* webhook the glasses would have used
(`BlePhotoUploadService.uploadToWebhook`, Android `utils/BlePhotoUploadService.java:442`,
iOS `MentraLive.swift:417`). So a miniapp running on/near the phone gets its photo by
round-tripping the bytes through the internet back to itself ("webhook to self").

This blocks airgapped Mentra Live deployments and is the wrong default for future
BT-Classic glasses where bytes always land on the phone first. The miniapp should
receive the image data directly and decide what to do with it.

## Current state (mapped 2026-07-28)

**Glasses (`asg_client`)** — `PhotoCommandHandler.processPhotoCapture` routes on
`transferMethod` (`auto|direct|ble`) + `webhookUrl` + `save`:

| condition | destination |
|---|---|
| `save && webhookUrl empty` | local gallery only, no upload/BLE |
| `direct` | glasses HTTP POST → webhookUrl |
| `ble` | K900 file transfer → phone |
| `auto` | WiFi present → direct upload; else BLE; upload failure falls back to BLE |

**Phone (bluetooth-sdk)** — BLE reassembly completes in
`processAndUploadBlePhoto` (Android `MentraLive.kt:8777`, iOS `MentraLive.swift:4015`):
writes an app-private debug `.avif`, converts AVIF→JPEG preserving IMU EXIF, then
uploads to `webhookUrl`. The phone already holds the decoded bytes here — this is the
natural insertion point.

**Existing escape hatch** — `MentraPhotoReceiverModule` + `LocalPhotoUploadServer`
(ports 8787–8790): a consumer app starts an in-process HTTP server and passes its LAN
URL as `webhookUrl`. WiFi path: glasses POST over LAN. BLE path: Android rewrites the
host to `127.0.0.1` via `LocalPhotoReceiverRegistry.loopbackUploadUrlFor()`
(`BlePhotoUploadService.resolvePhoneRelayWebhookUrl:526`). **iOS has no loopback
rewrite** — its BLE relay posts to the literal LAN URL, which breaks off-WiFi.

**Mentra App / local miniapps** — `PhonePhotoCoordinator.ts:193` gets a presigned
cloud upload URL (`startManagedPhoto`), passes it as `webhookUrl`, awaits cloud-v2
`photo.ready {readUrl}`. So even local miniapps' BLE photos detour through R2.
cloud-v2 `photoOptionsSchema` accepts `{size, compress, saveToGallery, sound}` but the
runtime discards them (`camera.service.ts:76` — `void opts;`).

**Cloud miniapps (v1)** — webhook URL minted in `PhotoManager.ts:88-99`
(`customWebhookUrl` else `${app.publicUrl}/photo-upload`). Known bug found while
mapping: `saveToGallery` is accepted by the SDK but dropped from the message sent to
glasses (`PhotoManager.ts:135-149`).

**Camera-roll machinery already exists** (gallery sync only today):
`cameraRollExportCoordinator` → `CrustModule.saveToGalleryWithDate`
(Android `CrustModule.kt:534` MediaStore, iOS `CrustModule.swift:466` PHPhotoLibrary),
date-preserving, with permission/retry state machine.

## Goals

1. A first-class delivery option on `requestPhoto` meaning "give the bytes to the
   phone; do not upload to a webhook."
2. Optional save to the phone's camera roll as part of that delivery.
3. Local-miniapp photos are BLE-only and never touch Cloudflare: no presigned R2
   upload/read URLs, no cloud round trip anywhere in the request path — which makes
   airgapped Mentra Live work by construction.
4. iOS/Android parity, including fixing the existing iOS loopback-rewrite gap.

## Non-goals (follow-ups, not this ticket)

- Changing the *default* path for cloud miniapps (v1 `PhotoManager`). Flipping the
  default to phone-delivery is a separate, riskier change once the option ships.
- Raw-bytes-over-websocket delivery to cloud miniapps (only precedent is the
  deprecated base64 `photo_taken` broadcast).
- Fixing the dropped `saveToGallery` in v1 `PhotoManager` (file separately; one-line
  plumb but needs glasses-side confirmation).

## Design

### New API surface (bluetooth-sdk)

A flat `delivery?: "webhook" | "phone"` flag would multiply invalid states
(`delivery: "phone"` + `webhookUrl` set; `delivery: "webhook"` with no URL;
`transferMethod: "direct"` with phone delivery). The existing `save` flag has the
same disease in disguise: it is not orthogonal to destination — on the glasses,
`save=true` + empty `webhookUrl` is the magic combo that routes to
*glasses-local-only capture* (`PhotoCommandHandler.java:362`, checked before any
transfer-method branch), so `save` secretly encodes a third destination. Model all
of it as one discriminated union so every invalid combination is unrepresentable:

```ts
type PhotoDestination =
  | {
      kind: "webhook";
      url: string;                       // required — no URL-less webhook state
      authToken?: string;
      transferMethod?: PhotoTransferMethod; // auto|direct|ble — only meaningful here
      keepOnGlasses?: boolean;           // also keep a copy in the glasses gallery
    }
  | {
      kind: "phone";
      saveToCameraRoll?: boolean;        // only exists on this arm
      keepOnGlasses?: boolean;           // see wire-mapping note below
      // no url/authToken/transferMethod: phone delivery always rides BLE
    }
  | {
      kind: "glasses";                   // gallery-only capture; no transfer at all
      // nothing to configure: this IS "save on glasses", so no keepOnGlasses flag
    };

interface PhotoRequestParams {
  destination: PhotoDestination;
  size?: ...; compress?: ...; sound?: ...; // unchanged capture options
  // `save` is deleted — its meanings are absorbed by the union
}
```

Wire mapping (the `take_photo` JSON keeps its current fields; only the SDK-side
type changes):
- `{kind: "webhook", keepOnGlasses}` → `webhookUrl` + `save: keepOnGlasses`.
  Valid today: with a non-empty webhook the glasses capture into the permanent
  gallery tree *and* deliver (`PhotoCommandHandler.java:303`).
- `{kind: "glasses"}` → `save: true`, no `webhookUrl`, no `bleImgId` — exactly
  today's local-save route, now expressed explicitly instead of via the magic combo.
- `{kind: "phone"}` → `transferMethod: "ble"` + `bleImgId`, no `webhookUrl`,
  `save: keepOnGlasses`. **Caveat:** with `keepOnGlasses: true` this trips the
  `:362` local-save-only check on pre-fix firmware (the BLE transfer would never
  start). Fix is a one-line asg_client routing change — the `:362` archival route additionally requires `transferMethod` ≠ `ble` (PR 2a, #3616), shipped ahead of the SDK change. It deliberately does not key on `bleImgId`: both Mentra Live serializers mint a `bleImgId` on every `take_photo` as a fallback id, including today's save-only archival captures, so a `bleImgId` gate would misroute those during the firmware-first window. Glasses OTA updates
  are mandatory now, so no legacy-firmware compat handling is needed in the SDK;
  the only requirement is release ordering (2a's firmware rolls out before 2b
  reaches users).

Back-compat: keep the existing top-level `webhookUrl`/`authToken`/`transferMethod`/
`save` fields as deprecated inputs; when `destination` is absent the SDK normalizes
them — `webhookUrl` present → `{kind: "webhook", keepOnGlasses: save}`;
`save: true` + no webhook → `{kind: "glasses"}` — and rejects requests that mix the
old fields with a `destination`.

### Remaining invalid-state audit of `PhotoRequestParams`

Full sweep of the current type (`BluetoothSdk.types.ts:573`) for other
incoherent combinations:

- **Killed by the union already:** `webhookUrl`/`authToken` are `string | null`
  *required-nullable* today, so `authToken` set with `webhookUrl: null` is
  representable and meaningless. The webhook arm (required `url`, optional
  `authToken`) removes it. Verified non-issue: `bleImgId` is not in the TS surface —
  it's generated natively — so no `ble`-without-`bleImgId` state exists at the API
  layer.
- **Exposure/capture cluster (same disease; deferred to a follow-up so PR 2b stays a delivery-only API change):** the type carries
  `exposureTimeNs`, `iso` ("only used when exposureTimeNs enables manual exposure"),
  `aeExposureDivisor`/`isoCap` (AE-metered "scan mode"), and `zsl`/`mfnr` ("forced
  off for manual/scan stills"). Today `iso` without `exposureTimeNs` is silently
  ignored, `zsl`/`mfnr` with manual exposure are silently overridden, and
  `aeExposureDivisor` (metered) with `exposureTimeNs` (fixed) is contradictory.
  Candidate follow-up: fold into a second small union:

  ```ts
  exposure?:
    | { kind: "auto"; zsl?: boolean; mfnr?: boolean }
    | { kind: "manual"; timeNs: number; iso?: number }
    | { kind: "scan"; aeExposureDivisor?: number; isoCap?: number };
  ```

  (`noiseReduction`/`edgeEnhancement`/isp gains stay flat — glasses-side
  best-effort, no cross-field constraints.)
- **`compress` vs transport (decide in PR 2b):** the BLE path re-encodes via
  `BlePhotoEncoders` (AVIF/fast-JPEG) and the phone transcodes to JPEG q90
  regardless of `compress` — so `compress: "none"` on the phone arm (or any
  BLE-forced transfer) is a promise the pipeline can't keep, and `size: "max"` over
  BLE is technically valid but slow. Proposal: the phone arm omits `compress`
  entirely (transport codec policy governs); on the webhook arm it keeps today's
  meaning for direct upload and is documented as advisory when the BLE fallback
  kicks in. Type-level where possible, documented where the fallback makes it
  runtime-dependent.
- **Loopback URL + `transferMethod: "direct"` (validation, not types):**
  `{kind: "webhook", url: "http://127.0.0.1:...", transferMethod: "direct"}` is
  unreachable by construction — the glasses can't hit the phone's loopback; the
  `LocalPhotoReceiverRegistry` rewrite only exists on the BLE relay. The URL's
  loopback-ness isn't expressible in types, so this one is a runtime validation:
  reject loopback/link-local URLs with `direct`, and keep the existing
  force-BLE-for-loopback behavior for `auto`.

`kind: "phone"` semantics:
- Result event carries the photo itself: extend the existing `photo_response`
  terminal event with `{ requestId, fileUri, mimeType, byteCount, savedToCameraRoll? }`.
  The file is written to app-private storage (reuse the `MentraLive_Images` dir that
  already receives the debug copy; write the *converted JPEG*, not the raw AVIF, and
  stop double-writing the debug `.avif` for this mode).

### Native behavior per route

- **BLE route** (the common no-WiFi case): branch in `processAndUploadBlePhoto`
  (`MentraLive.kt:8777` / `MentraLive.swift:4015`): convert AVIF→JPEG as today, skip
  `uploadToWebhook`, persist JPEG, optionally `CrustModule.saveToGalleryWithDate`,
  emit terminal success with `fileUri`. No HTTP at all — do *not* route through the
  loopback local-server for this mode; handing bytes straight to the event is simpler
  and works identically on iOS.
- **WiFi-direct route**: the glasses need *some* HTTP destination. With the union,
  `kind: "phone"` simply has no direct route — the SDK builds the `take_photo`
  command (`MentraLive.kt:5506`) with `transferMethod: "ble"` and no `webhookUrl`.
  Rationale: no dependency on phone+glasses sharing a LAN, works airgapped by
  construction, and BLE-photo latency is already acceptable (that's the whole
  fallback path). Keeps the change surface phone-side only — **no asg_client
  firmware change required** except the one-line `:362` routing gate needed for
  `keepOnGlasses` on the phone arm (see wire mapping above). (Rejected for v1: auto-starting
  `LocalPhotoUploadServer` and passing its LAN URL as the webhook — faster on WiFi
  but needs LAN co-presence, LAN-IP discovery, and the iOS loopback fix first. Can be
  layered in later as a transparent optimization without API change.)
- **Camera roll**: gate on the existing `MediaLibraryPermissions` flow; if permission
  is denied, still deliver `fileUri` and set `savedToCameraRoll: false` with an error
  detail rather than failing the photo.

### iOS loopback parity fix (independent, do first)

Port `LocalPhotoReceiverRegistry.loopbackUploadUrlFor()` behavior to iOS
`BlePhotoUploadService` so a BLE relay targeting the app's own
`LocalPhotoUploadServer` rewrites to `127.0.0.1`. This fixes the existing
photo-receiver escape hatch off-WiFi on iOS regardless of the new option.

### Miniapp SDK / engine: BLE-only, the miniapp gets the bytes (default, not opt-in)

Today `PhonePhotoCoordinator.ts:193` always mints a presigned upload/read pair via
`startManagedPhoto` and hands the `uploadUrl` down as `webhookUrl` — so a photo that
arrives over BLE gets re-uploaded from the phone to the cloud runtime just so the
miniapp can fetch it back via `readUrl`. (Note: every deployed runtime answers the
blob route with the local provider's response, so in practice this relay lands on
the runtime's own disk, not R2.) That relay is removed for local miniapps:

**Decision (2026-07-28): local-miniapp photos are BLE-only.** No WiFi-direct path,
no `startManagedPhoto`, no presign — ever — for local miniapps.

**Decision (2026-08-24, Israel, on the ticket): `takePhoto` hands the miniapp the
photo itself (bytes/URI/data), not a download URL.** The July draft of PR 3
published the delivered JPEG through the runtime's local camera-blob route and
returned that runtime-served URL. That is dropped: the runtime is cloud-hosted, so
the publish is still a cloud round trip (airgap fails by construction), the local
blob route is unauthenticated, and the ticket now forbids the download-URL contract.

- **One transport.** The coordinator always requests
  `destination: {kind: "phone"}`; the glasses never attempt a WiFi upload for these
  requests (the union forces `transferMethod: "ble"`). No mint means no cloud round
  trip in the request path, so airgap works by construction and there is no
  auto-mode ambiguity, no prediction, no fallback bookkeeping.
- **One completion path.** When the JPEG lands on the phone (`fileUri` on the
  terminal `photo_response`), the coordinator reads it and resolves the miniapp with
  `PhotoTaken {requestId, dataUrl, photoUrl, mimeType, size}` where `dataUrl` is the
  inline `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` image and `photoUrl` carries the same data URL,
  so code that renders `photoUrl` keeps working (the background runtime's `fetch` is
  a native HTTP bridge that does not accept data URLs — decode `dataUrl` for bytes).
  Deadline chain: Bluetooth SDK phone delivery 60 s (vs 30 s for webhook requests) <
  coordinator watchdog 75 s < miniapp SDK `takePhoto` default 90 s, so every layer
  reports its typed error before the next one's generic timeout. The SDK never
  prompts for camera-roll permission inside a capture (the app holds it up front),
  so nothing user-driven sits inside those deadlines. The bundled
  Mentra AI miniapp already prefers `dataUrl` and treats `photoUrl` as cloud-only.
  The delivered file is deleted once read (camera-roll copies are the user's and
  untouched). No runtime or cloud request anywhere in the flow.
- **Accepted trade-off:** heavy captures (`size: "max"`) ride BLE too — slower
  transfer, and the BLE encode/transcode pipeline governs final quality — and the
  base64 payload crosses the miniapp transport in one message (the blob module
  already moves 1 MB chunks that way). Document this in the miniapp SDK photo
  options. If a real need for fast full-quality delivery materializes, a WiFi-direct
  perf path is a well-understood follow-up — deliberately not built now.
- cloud-v2 is untouched by PR 3: the local-miniapp path no longer goes through the
  runtime at all, so `photoOptionsSchema` / `camera.service.ts` (`void opts;`) only
  matter for cloud-client hosts and stay as they are. `saveToCameraRoll` is a
  miniapp-SDK option plumbed `camera.ts` → `LocalMiniappRuntime` → coordinator.
- cloud-v2 dead code this exposes: with no local-miniapp uploads, audit whether
  `miniapp-sdk-photo-storage.service.ts` / the storage-events route have remaining
  callers before removing anything (cloud-hosted miniapps are out of scope here).
- Airgapped devices follow from the default: no WiFi upload path → BLE transport →
  inline delivery. A device-level "force BLE / airgap" setting can pin the transport
  decision but needs no new delivery API.

## Milestones / PR breakdown

1. **PR 1 — iOS loopback rewrite parity** (bluetooth-sdk/ios). Small, standalone,
   fixes an existing bug. On-device iOS verification with the example app's photo
   receiver, phone off WiFi.
2. **PR 2a — asg_client routing gate** (one line + test): local-save-only route at `PhotoCommandHandler.java:362` additionally requires `transferMethod` ≠ `ble` (not an empty `bleImgId`, which the SDK mints on every request), so `save: true` + explicit BLE delivery coexist. Ship ahead of PR 2b via the normal firmware
   train; no behavior change for any request shape phones send today.
3. **PR 2b — `destination` union (webhook/phone/glasses) + `saveToCameraRoll` in
   bluetooth-sdk** (types + Android + iOS + example app toggle, with
   deprecated-field normalization replacing `save`). Same PR takes `compress` scoped to the webhook arm and loopback-URL + `direct` runtime rejection; the `exposure` sub-union is deferred to a follow-up. PR 1 is folded into this PR (#3619) after the July stack went stale against dev. `kind: "phone"` always rides
   BLE; phone-arm `keepOnGlasses` requires PR 2a's firmware, guaranteed by
   mandatory OTA — releases only after 2a's firmware is rolled out. Unit tests for
   the request-builder (union → `take_photo` JSON, old-field normalization incl.
   `save`, mixed old/new rejection) and the terminal-event shape; hardware
   verification both platforms (photo lands in `fileUri`, camera roll opt-in works,
   permission-denied degrades gracefully, phone-arm `keepOnGlasses` leaves a
   gallery copy). Version-bump the SDK per the usual dev-release flow.
4. **PR 3 — local-miniapp photos BLE-only, delivered inline** (`PhonePhotoCoordinator`,
   `LocalMiniappRuntime`, miniapp SDK `camera.ts`). Coordinator always uses
   `{kind: "phone"}`; `startManagedPhoto` / presign are removed from the
   local-miniapp flow; completion resolves the miniapp with `dataUrl`. Test with a
   local miniapp with networking disabled (airgap simulation) and confirm the
   photo renders from `dataUrl` and no cloud request is made at any point.
5. **Follow-ups (separate tickets)**: LAN-receiver optimization for WiFi-present
   phone delivery; flipping the default delivery for BT-Classic glasses; v1
   `PhotoManager` `saveToGallery` drop; deciding the cloud-miniapp story (presigned
   URL vs webhook default).

## Test plan

- Unit: `take_photo` command builder (`kind: "phone"` forces `ble`, omits webhook
  fields; deprecated-field normalization; mixed old/new rejection); BLE completion
  branch (upload skipped, event payload); camera-roll gating.
- Maestro/E2E: photo request from example app with `destination: {kind: "phone"}`,
  assert `photo_response` carries a readable `fileUri`; local miniapp photo asserts
  no request ever hits an R2/cloud host when transport is BLE.
- Hardware (Mentra Live, both phone platforms): BLE-only (WiFi off on glasses and
  phone), WiFi-on (verify forced-BLE still delivers), camera-roll save with
  permission granted/denied, EXIF UserComment preserved after conversion.
- Airgap: local miniapp photo round-trip with cloud unreachable.

## Decisions (all resolved 2026-07-28)

1. **Pre-PR-2a firmware compat: moot.** Glasses OTA updates are mandatory now, so
   the SDK carries no legacy-firmware handling for
   `{kind: "phone", keepOnGlasses: true}`. The only requirement is release
   ordering: PR 2a's firmware rolls out before PR 2b reaches users.
2. **Terminal event payload: `fileUri` only.** Keep bridge/event messages as tiny
   as possible — no inline base64, no size-threshold behavior. The file must exist
   anyway (camera-roll export, retention), and consumers that want bytes read the
   file.
3. **Local-miniapp photos are BLE-only.** No mint, no WiFi-direct, no prediction;
   single completion path: the coordinator hands the miniapp an inline `dataUrl`
   (2026-08-24 ticket note supersedes the July runtime-blob completion). A
   WiFi-direct perf path for heavy captures is a possible future follow-up,
   deliberately not built now.
4. **Retention: SDK-owned sweep of `MentraLive_Images`.** Phone-delivered JPEGs
   stay in `MentraLive_Images`; the SDK owns cleanup (age TTL ~24h + total-size
   cap, swept on session start), documented as "`fileUri` valid for at least N
   hours; copy it if you need it longer." Legacy debug `.avif` copies fold into
   the same sweep; camera-roll copies are the user's and are never touched. The
   size cap can evict files younger than 24h after a burst of large captures, and
   the type documents exactly that. The local-miniapp coordinator deletes its
   delivered file as soon as it has read it.
